usage: sd <command> | sd --help

COMMANDS =============================================================

init | remove                                  :before integrity check
  -init
  inititialize sd repository for current directory.
  it's the first job to do before utilize any functionality of sd.
  if sd repository already exist, it will report error.

  -remove
  remove sd reposityroy for current directory.
  all data will be lost, no recuvery supported.
  that's why this commands require comfirmation 3 times, which
  last comfirm require the EXACT ANSWER (YES) to proceed.

set <figname> <val> | get [<figname>..]               :topic configure
  -set <figname> <val>
  set <figname> variable specified in the fig to <val>
  e.g) sd set SOURCENAME main.c
  acctually it's just shell variables that will be set when sd runs.
  so, setting ANY variable is possible to adjust operation of sd.
  though some variables would be overwritten by loading modules.
  these are verified variables that you can set (sd will not overwrite)
    SOURCENAME - source file name
    EXECNAME   - excuted file name
    TESTIONAME - IO file name

  -get
  show the settings in fig for specified <figname>s.
  if none specified, then prints out all figs.

co | te | ve                                 :with source of a version
  -co
  compile with default command selected from extension of src.
  -te
  test with excutable with input-output set specified in IO files
  -ve
  prints out current version.

ne | st [src1] [src2] | df [src1] [src2]     :with versions of sources
  -ne
  save current version of source code to achieve,
  then update version number
  -st
  show status (lines, characters) of specified source file, compared
  with other. - provided focused on short coding traning.
    st - current status compared with the latest (right before of it)
    st <src1> - status of src1 compared with right before
    st <src1> <src2> - status of src2 compared with src1
  -df
  show diff of specified source file, compared with other.
    df - diff between current and the latest (right before of it)
    df <src1> - diff between src1 and right before
    df <src1> <src2> - diff between src1 and src2

help | --help                          :when you don't know what to do
  print this manual


CONCEPTS =============================================================

  fig - what is it (get it from set), topic independent
  iofile - how to use
  version - it is provided for short coding practice
            iofile not changing recommanded but supported
            not changing extensiong recommanded but supporte
